My name is Kevin Ramos, and I am a software developer with expertise in Android and Kotlin. I write readable and performant UI code with Jetpack Compose, and clean and modern Android architecture using the MVVM design pattern.

I'm an engineer at heart, and working on complex technical systems is thrilling. Likewise, I've been perfecting my development skills for the past two years. Some of my best accomplishments have been publishing an app to the Play Store, working on the NPR Android development team, and writing my own NES emulator in Kotlin.

How fantastic it is to love what you do!
